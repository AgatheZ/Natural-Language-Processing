# Natural-Language-Processing

Participation to the SemEval 2022 task on Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL) Detection. This task is based on the paper Don't Patronize Me! An annotated Dataset with Patronizing and Condescending Language Towards Vulnerable Communities (Perez-Almendros et al., 2020).

The aim of this task is to build a model able to differenciate patronizing from non-patronizing sentences.
